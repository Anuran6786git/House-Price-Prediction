# House-Price-Prediction-Model
Predicting house prices is a classic machine learning regression problem. The machine learning model is build using Python and some popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn,Tenserflow. 
#Objective: To Build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc.
#Dataset: Datasets like the Boston Housing Dataset from scikit-learn or real estate datasets from kaggle are used.
#Procedure:
1.The necessary Libraries are imported.
2.The Dataset is loaded and explored.
3.The missing values are handled,  categorical variables are encoded, and  features are preprocessed.
4.The data is splitted into training and testing data.
5.The data is Standardized.
6.The Model is Build and trained.
7.Predictions are made.
8.The Model is Evaluated.
